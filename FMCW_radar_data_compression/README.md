This folder contains the slide show PDF and the corresponding .tex source. Inside the Code folder are stored all the MATLAB files used to generate the presented results.
Our project focus on compressing FMCW radar data by exploiting the stationary nature of the analyzed signal.
First, we apply Linear Predictive Coding to reduce the dynamic of the signal, then we use Huffman coding to further shrink the output file and improve the overall compression ratio.
